# Voice Recognition Google Chrome Extension

Our goal is to create a chrome extension that enhances Google's voice recognition. We would like to add features like telling Google, "hey Google, I'm going on a run" and have Google remind you to grab your water bottle, earbuds, and tell you the weather. We want it to be customizable with a notes section. It can check off a to do list for you as well. Instead of reminders solely based on time, it could also remind you of things based on sporadic events. We will be using HTML, CSS, various APIs, and JavaScript.
