## I. Introduction
Our project A.V.E.R.I (Another Voice Expert Recognition Interface) is an Android app that allows users to create personalized, situation-based reminder events using voice recognition. The motivation for our project was J.A.R.V.I.S. from Marvel. 

Originally, we intended for A.V.E.R.I. to be a Google Chrome extension, but we changed A.V.E.R.I. to be a mobile application since voice recognition is easier to integrate with mobile apps. Due to this change, we changed our approach to this project. The first step in our project design was to create a good UI prototype to determine the general layout and key features for our mobile app. Then, we used the app prototype as a guide for developing the actual app. Lastly, we implemented some voice recognition capabilities.

## IV. Team
In our project proposal, we designated preliminary roles for each team member:
* Sehee: Back-end
* Pei: Front-end and user interface/user experience
* Andy: Back-end
* Kedar: Front-end and user interface/user experience
Additionally in our project proposal, we specified for roles to be rotating to allow each team member to gain experience in different areas of the project.

As we progressed through the project, our roles became more static:
* Sehee: User interface/user experience
* Pei: Back-end
* Andy: Back-end
* Kedar: Front-end

Every team member contributed as equally as we could have hoped.

## V. Project Management
Due to difficulty learning how to use Android Studios, we were not able to complete all of the goals we originally intended for A.V.E.R.I. In hindsight, we believe our original expectations for A.V.E.R.I. were quite ambitious, considering that none of our team members had previous experience with Android Studios or building a mobile application in general.
