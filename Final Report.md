## I. Introduction
Our project A.V.E.R.I (Another Voice Expert Recognition Interface) is an Android app that allows users to set reminder events based on a date or location. A.V.E.R.I. also allows users to set personalized, situation-based reminder events with some voice recognition functionalities. The motivation for our project was J.A.R.V.I.S. from Marvel. 

Originally, we intended for A.V.E.R.I. to be a Google Chrome extension, but we changed A.V.E.R.I. to be a mobile application since voice recognition is easier to integrate with mobile apps. Along with this change, we refined our objectives for this project. Our first goal was to create a good UI prototype to determine the general layout and key features for our mobile app. After designing a prototype, we then wanted to develop the actual app. An important change to note is that we decided to switch our focus on the ability for users to set reminders based on a certain date or location, as opposed to situations or keywords. Lastly, we wanted to implement some voice recognition capabilities if we had remaining time.

## II. Customer Value
In our project proposal, we defined our primary customer as anyone who does not have prior knowledge on technology or anyone who may need additional accessibility to perform commands. 

As previously mentioned, we originally intended A.V.E.R.I. to be a Google extension, but changed it to be an Android application. Moreover, we changed our focus on the ability to set reminders based on a date or location. Unfortunately, this shift in focus likely resulted in a loss of customer value. Fewer voice functionalities means users spend more time and effort manually setting reminders and lose the ease that comes with setting reminders through a voice assistant. Additionally, as there is already several existing software for setting reminders, our product likly decreased its market value.

The Google Play Store will serve as the media for customers to write their reviews on. In regards to our customer-centric measures of success, we still believe that this will be based on how many users deem our app as an essential to their everyday life.

## IV. Team
In our project proposal, we designated preliminary roles for each team member:
* Sehee: Back-end
* Pei: Front-end and user interface/user experience
* Andy: Back-end
* Kedar: Front-end and user interface/user experience
Additionally in our project proposal, we specified for roles to be rotating to allow each team member to gain experience in different areas of the project.

As we progressed through the project, our roles became more static:
* Sehee: User interface/user experience
* Pei: Back-end
* Andy: Back-end
* Kedar: Front-end

Every team member contributed as equally as we could have hoped.

## V. Project Management
Due to difficulty learning how to use Android Studios, we were not able to complete all of the goals we originally intended for A.V.E.R.I. In hindsight, we believe our original expectations for A.V.E.R.I. were quite ambitious, considering that none of our team members had previous experience with Android Studios or building a mobile application in general.
